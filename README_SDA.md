# SmallDrawingApp
This app was made just for fun and to learn how to do the thing that it does, of course drawing on a panel.
The application is made of a window with a panel on which a user can draw on.
The user can switch through the given colors and if needed or wanted by the user he can erase with the eraser.
Plane and simple.
